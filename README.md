# My Journey of Learning C++ and DSA

Welcome to my GitHub repository documenting my journey of learning C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). This repository contains various projects, exercises, and assignments that I have worked on as I progressed through learning C++ and mastering DSA concepts.

## Repository Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of my work in C++ and DSA, demonstrating my growth and understanding of these subjects.

## Repository Link

You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/MITTALBHAVYA/journey2c-).

## Contents

1. **Basic C++ Programs**
   - Simple programs to understand the syntax and features of C++.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Projects and examples demonstrating OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

3. **Data Structures**
   - Implementations and examples of fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

4. **Algorithms**
   - Various sorting and searching algorithms, along with examples of their usage.

5. **Advanced C++ Concepts**
   - Programs exploring advanced topics like templates, exception handling, and file I/O.

6. **Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms**
   - Exercises and projects on dynamic programming techniques and greedy algorithms.

7. **Graph Algorithms**
   - Implementation of graph traversal algorithms like DFS, BFS, and shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford.

8. **Tree Algorithms**
   - Programs on binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and other tree-related algorithms.

9. **Competitive Programming Practice**
   - Solutions to problems from competitive programming platforms, focusing on algorithmic challenges and problem-solving skills.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming and data structures

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MITTALBHAVYA/journey2c-.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd journey2c-
   ```

### Running the Programs

To compile and run any of the programs, use the following commands in your terminal:

1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ program_name.cpp -o program_name
   ```
2. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and apply the fundamental concepts of C++.
- Gain proficiency in object-oriented programming.
- Master the implementation and usage of various data structures.
- Develop a strong understanding of algorithms and their complexities.
- Enhance problem-solving skills through competitive programming practice.
